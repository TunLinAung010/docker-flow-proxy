The goal of the *Docker Flow Proxy* project is to provide an easy way to reconfigure proxy every time a new service is deployed, or when a service is scaled. It does not try to "reinvent the wheel", but to leverage the existing leaders and combine them through an easy to use integration. It uses [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) as a proxy and adds custom logic that allows on-demand reconfiguration.

Supported architectures are:

- linux-amd64
- linux-arm
